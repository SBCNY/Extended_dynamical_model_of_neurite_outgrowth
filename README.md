# Extended_dynamical_model_of_neurite_outgrowth

This script is an extension of our original NOG model ("www.github.com/SBCNY/Dynamical-Model-of-Neurite-Outgrowth") and was used to generate figure 4B in our manuscript Hansen et al. 2022.<br>
<br>
To reproduce the published figure, please open and run the file "NOG_analytical_SCP_activities_vesicular_transport.m" with MATLAB. The generated results file "NOG_analytical_SCP_activities_vesicular_transport.png" contains the figures added to our manuscript.<br>
<br>
For details, please have a look at our two publications:<br>
